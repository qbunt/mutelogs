## Mutelogs.js
A simple/fast/easy no-dependency way to reversibly mute all the `console.*` methods from any JavaScript project. The advantage to this approach is that logs can simply be hidden behind a feature flag.

Not saying that this is a great approach, but for libraries that already log too much, this is a way to quickly mute all the console messages generated by JavaScript by your app or dependencies.

#### To mute all `console.*` methods
`mute.logs(true);`

#### To unmute all `console.*` methods
`mute.logs(false);`
